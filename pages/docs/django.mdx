# Django Projects

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

**Download:**

1. Download and install new version Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).
2. Download a code editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

**Create virtual environment:**

```bash copy
python -m venv venv
```

**Activate virtual environment:**

```bash copy
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Deactivate virtual environment:**

```bash copy
deactivate
```

**Install Django:**

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Django.

```bash copy
pip install django
```

## Create Project

Django comes with a command-line utility called **django-admin** that lets you interact with Django projects in various ways. You can read all the options available to **django-admin** by running **django-admin help**. We will use **django-admin** to create the skeleton of a new Django project.

**Create a new project:**

```bash copy
django-admin startproject mysite
```

**Run the server:**

```bash copy
python manage.py runserver
```

**Create a new app:**

```bash copy
python manage.py startapp blog
```

**Create migrations:**

```bash copy
python manage.py makemigrations
```

**Migrate the database:**

```bash copy
python manage.py migrate
```

**Collect static files:**

```bash copy
python manage.py collectstatic
```

**Run the tests:**

```bash copy
python manage.py test
```

**Create requirements.txt file:**

```bash copy
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Install requirements.txt file:**

```bash copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create a new project with PostgreSQL:**

```bash copy
django-admin startproject mysite --database=postgresql
```

**Create a new project with MySQL:**

```bash copy
django-admin startproject mysite --database=mysql
```

## Django Admin

Django Admin is a powerful tool for managing data in your app. It’s free and open source.

**Create a superuser:**

```bash copy
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Now, setup your admin username and password configurations:

```yml copy
Username: admin
Email address: admin@gmail.com
Password: yourpassword
Password (again): yourpassword
# Superuser created successfully.
```
